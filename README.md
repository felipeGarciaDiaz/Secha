# Secha
NodeJS tool to send messages. Get your message across just right.
## What this isaccess 
Secha is an email sender, that allows you to spoof, spam, and create emails and send to anyone you desire. Created via NodeJS using SMTP protocols, and added logging for security.
## Why I Made This
I wanted to further improve my NodeJS capabilities, with an interesting project. I wanted to do a project that would be able to email accounts, and send stuff with the users control. This proof of concept could also function with SMS messaging.
